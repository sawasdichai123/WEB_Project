# Project Documentation

## Overview
This project appears to be related to a booking management system, with a frontend interface, backend logic, and a database schema.

### Project Structure
- **.vscode/**: Contains editor configuration files for development (e.g., settings for Visual Studio Code).
- **backend/**: Likely contains server-side code handling the application logic and API endpoints.
- **frontend/**: Likely contains client-side code, including user interface files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- **bookings.sql**: SQL file containing the database schema or data to set up the booking system database.

## Instructions

### Setting Up
1. **Database**:
   - Use the `bookings.sql` file to initialize the database. 
   - Execute the SQL file in your preferred database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
   
2. **Backend**:
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
   - Check for dependencies (usually in a file like `requirements.txt` for Python or `package.json` for Node.js).
   - Follow the instructions for running the backend (e.g., `python manage.py runserver` or `npm start`).

3. **Frontend**:
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
   - Open the index file in a browser or serve it using a local server (e.g., using `npm start` or `serve`).

### Development Tools
- **.vscode/**:
  - Configuration files might be present to help set up debugging or linting in VS Code.

## Notes
- Ensure proper environment setup for the backend and frontend (e.g., Node.js for JavaScript projects, Python environment for Python projects).
- Check for additional documentation within the backend and frontend directories for more specific instructions.

## Contributions
Feel free to add additional documentation or enhancements to improve the project's functionality and usability.
